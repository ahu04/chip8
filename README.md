# chip-8 emulator

> CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine.

Chip-8 allowed video games to be more easily programmable, and portable on early PCs. Its simplicity and popularity means that there are emulators and ROMs being written even today, and a plethora of resources on how to implement an emulator myself.

I wanted to learn Rust, and chip8 is a classic systems project, so here I am! 

Still a WIP.
